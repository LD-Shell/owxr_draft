    "body": "# Event Success: High School Crystal Growth Challenge\n\nThe Welch Center hosted its annual High School Crystal Growth Challenge, bringing together 50 talented students from various Houston-area high schools.\n\n## The Experience\n\nParticipants spent a full day in our advanced microscopy and wet labs. The focus was on applied physical chemistry, teaching students the principles of **controlled crystallization** that underpin pharmaceutical development.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n\n* **Nucleation:** Understanding the critical size required for a crystal seed to survive.\n* **Growth:** The influence of temperature and agitation on growth kinetics.\n* **Purity:** Techniques for minimizing impurities to achieve perfect crystal habit.\n\nThe winning team, 'Crystal Clear Minds,' grew the largest and most perfect potassium alum crystal, earning them scholarships to the UH summer science program. \"It was amazing to see science in action,\" said team leader Maria Rodriguez.\n\nThis initiative helps demystify advanced materials science and provides hands-on experience not typically available in high school settings. We look forward to next year's competition!",
