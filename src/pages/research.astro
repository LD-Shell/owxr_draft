            <p>Our work is organized into three primary aims, tackling the lifecycle of a crystal from its birth to its final form.</p>

        <div class="aim-card">
            <span class="aim-number">01</span>
            <h3>Aim 1: Nucleation Mechanisms</h3>
            <p>We investigate the non-classical pathways of nucleation, using liquid-cell TEM and time-resolved spectroscopy.</p>

            <span class="aim-number">02</span>
            <h3>Aim 2: Crystal Growth Modifiers</h3>
            <p>Understanding how impurities, proteins, and tailor-made additives bind to specific crystal faces.</p>

            <h3>Aim 3: Polymorphism & Stability</h3>
            <p>Many compounds can crystallize into different lattice structures (polymorphs). We study the thermodynamics.</p>
